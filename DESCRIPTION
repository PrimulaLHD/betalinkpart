Version: 0.1.0
Author: Hai-Dong Li
Maintainer: The package maintainer <lihaidong1988@outlook.com>
Description: This package contains R functions to calculate two partitions of interaction turnover, i.e. species-driven (e.g. plant or animal driven in plant-animal interaction networks) and rewiring (interaction gain and loss). Please note: The R functions modified from Poisot et al. (2012) and Simanonok & Burkle (2014); this package just for my study, if you use this package, please cite the original references.
